 abstract = {We develop a positive theory of the hedging behavior of value-maximizing corporations. We treat hedging by corporations simply as one part of the firm's financing decisions. We examine (1) taxes, (2) contracting costs, and (3) the impact of hedging policy on the firm's investment decisions as explanations of the observed wide diversity of hedging practices among large, widely-held corporations. Our theory provides answers to the questions: (1) why some firms hedge and others do not; (2) why firms hedge some risks but not others; and (3) why some firms hedge their accounting risk exposure while others hedge their economic value.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a theory of corporate risk management that attempts to go beyond the “variance-minimization” model that dominates most academic discussions of the subject. It argues that the primary goal of risk management is not to dampen swings in corporate cash flows or value, but rather to provide protection against the possibility of costly lower-tail outcomes–situations that would cause financial distress or make a company unable to carry out its investment strategy. (In the jargon of finance specialists, risk management can be viewed as the purchase of well-out-of-the-money put options designed to limit downside risk.) By eliminating downside risk and reducing the expected costs of financial trouble, risk management can also help a company to achieve both its optimal capital structure and its optimal ownership structure. For, besides increasing corporate debt capacity, the reduction of downside risk also encourages larger equity stakes for managers by shielding their investments from “uncontrollables.” The paper also departs from standard finance theory in suggesting that some companies may have a comparative advantage in bearing certain financial market risks–an advantage that derives from information acquired through their normal business activities. Although such specialized information may lead some companies to take speculative positions in commodities or currencies, it is more likely to encourage “selective” hedging, a practice in which the risk manager's “view” of future price movements influences the percentage of the exposure that is hedged. But, to the extent that such view-taking becomes an accepted part of a company's risk management program, it is important to evaluate managers' bets on a risk-adjusted basis and relative to the market. If risk managers want to behave like money managers, they should be evaluated like money managers.},

First, it examines a much broader set of capital structure theories, many of which have not previously been analyzed empirically. Second, since the theories have different empirical implications in regard to different types of debt instruments, the authors analyze measures of short-term, long-term, and convertible debt rather than an aggregate measure of total debt. Third, the study uses a factor-analytic technique that mitigates the measurement problems encountered when working with proxy variables.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a general framework for analyzing corporate risk management policies. We begin by observing that if external sources of finance are more costly to corporations than internally generated funds, there will typically be a benefit to hedging: hedging adds value to the extent that it helps ensure that a corporation has sufficient internal funds available to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. We then argue that this simple observation has wide ranging implications for the design of risk management strategies. We delineate how these strategies should depend on such factors as shocks to investment and financing opportunities. We also discuss exchange rate hedging strategies for multinationals, as well as strategies involving “nonlinear” instruments like options.},

	abstract = {A casualty loss produces option-like characteristics in assets because their value depends on further discretionary investment. With risky debt in the firm's capital structure, the shareholders can have incentives to forgo the discretionary investment, even though it has a positive net present value. Thus a potential incentive conflict exists between the bondholders who want the investment made and the shareholders who do not. The incentive problem can be controlled by including a covenant in the bond contract requiring insurance coverage. Full coverage is generally not required. The maximum deductible depends on the amount of debt in the firm's capital structure and the feasible set of net casualty losses.},

However, firms whose managers hold more options manage less gold price risk, and firms whose managers hold more stock manage more gold price risk, suggesting that managerial risk aversion may affect corporate risk management policy. Further, risk management policy. Further, risk management is negatively associated with the tenure of firms' CFOs, perhaps reflecting managerial interests, skills, or preferences.},

	abstract = {Most previous studies of REIT-securitized real estate examine the performance of REITs versus only common stocks. In addition, previous studies have focused on the mean and standard deviation of returns, while this study also examines skewness, kurtosis, and conducts several tests of normality for the returns. The time series properties of the returns are also examined by calculating the autocorrelation function for each of the series. Finally, this study extends the results of Giliberto concerning the intertemporal relationship between REIT returns and real estate returns by examining a vector autoregressive model in which returns on pairs of assets are modeled as a linear function of lags of their own returns and lags of the returns on the other asset in the pair. Granger causality tests are also performed to determine if an asset's returns Granger cause the returns on the other asset. In a distributional and time series sense, equity REIT returns appear to be much more like those on common stocks and closed-end funds than those on unsecuritized commercial real estate. Intertemporally, REIT returns are much more strongly related to unsecuritized real estate than stocks or closed-end funds. The equity REIT index returns were found to Granger cause unsecuritized real estate returns for most of the real estate indices. Results were somewhat mixed for the individual REITs.},
